# Variational Autoencoder

Description of the theory of variational autoencoders as described in the paper Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes [[1]](#references) and implementation on the CelebA dataset [[2]](#references).

The notebook includes:
- Useful resources about variational autoencoders
- A refresher on information theory and more especially Kullback-Leibler divergence, needed to develop the variational bound
- A description of the problem and an expression of the variational bound following the notations of the aforementioned paper
- A hands-on implementation and training of a variational autoencoder on the CelebA dataset
- Example of interpolation in the latent space
